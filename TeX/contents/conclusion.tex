A sine wave is modulated using a $0-3.3$\unit{\volt} PWM output of a Teensy 4.1
microcontroller at a carrier frequency of $36.6$\unit{\kilo\hertz}. We presented
to second-order lowpass filters to extract the modulated signal from its PWM
representation: (i) $RC$+buffer configuration, (ii) Sallen-Key architecture. We
have shown that in simulation both perform similarly, however in experimentation
the Sallen-Key filter performs significantly better. We have decided to use this
filter in our final design on the bioreactor.
