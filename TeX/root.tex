% ADVICE TO STUDENTS: Each time you write a paper, start with this
%    template and save under a new filename.  If convenient, don't
%    erase unneeded lines, just comment them out.  Often, they
%    will be useful containers for information.

% PREAMBLE
% The preamble of a LaTeX document is the set of commands that precede
% the \begin{document} line.  It contains a \documentclass line
% to load the REVTeX-4 macro definitions and various \usepackage
% lines to load other macro packages.
%
% ADVICE TO STUDENTS: This preamble contains a suggested set of
%     class options to generate a ``Junior Lab'' look and feel that
%     facilitate quick review and feedback from one's peers, TA's
%     and section instructors.  Don't make substantial changes without
%     first consulting your section instructor.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\documentclass[aps,twocolumn,twoside,secnumarabic,balancelastpage,amsmath,amssymb,nofootinbib]{revtex4}

% Documentclass Options
    % aps, prl, rmp stand for American Physical Society, Physical Review Letters, and Reviews of Modern Physics, respectively
    % twocolumn permits two columns, of course
    % nobalancelastpage doesn't attempt to equalize the lengths of the two columns on the last page
        % as might be desired in a journal where articles follow one another closely
    % amsmath and amssymb are necessary for the subequations environment among others
    % secnumarabic identifies sections by number to aid electronic review and commentary.
    % nofootinbib forces footnotes to occur on the page where they are first referenced
        % and not in the bibliography
    % REVTeX 4 is a set of macro packages designed to be used with LaTeX 2e.
        % REVTeX is well-suited for preparing manuscripts for submission to APS journals.
