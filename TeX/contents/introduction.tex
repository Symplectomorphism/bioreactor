\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

We design an input PWM filter to create the desired $0-10$\unit{\volt} sine wave
at $90$\unit{\hertz} that the controller expects from a carrier PWM signal at a
carrier frequency $36.6$\unit{\kilo\hertz}. 

This technical report builds the final design up over a few major steps. For the
impatient reader, the theoretical analysis, its implementation, and the full
blown-up schematic of the final design are provided in
Section~\ref{ssec:sallenkey}, Section~\ref{sec:results}, and
Figure~\ref{fig:final_circuit} of the Appendix~\ref{sec:fulldesign},
respectively.
