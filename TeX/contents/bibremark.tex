\section{Bibliography Remarks}

Bibliographies are very important in scientific papers.  Beyond the requisite
citation of source material, they provide evidence of your literature research
beyond the experimental guides.  Literature searches, appropriate references to
other research, and bibliographies are an integral part of any type of research.
Bibliographic entries are made within a separate `.bib' file which gets attached
during the process of building a final PDF document.
